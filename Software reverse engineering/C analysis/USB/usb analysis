On system startup some data is configured for which I did not find corrosponding code in the USB project. (FUN_80021be0)

After this usb_dev_bsp_init() is called. All this does is configure the USB interface and sets it idle.

When check for new firmware fails (corrupted update file) it starts the USB interface so new firmware can be written.

The user can enable the USB interface via the menu option (enter_usb_connect())

With the function "setup_usb_int()" the USB interface is configured and interrupt is enabled.




Mass storage is the fourth device. Descriptor is found at 0x8019D23C. This is in the data being unpacked at startup
