//After a touch coordinate read the scope writes to fpga 0x0F and then reads from 0x14 two bytes.

FUN_8001BEC4 is where this is done (0x14)

At address 800253D8 the 0x0F command is written Data is 0x01 (FUN_80026728)

Also at address 802555C but this is followed by data 0x00

Also at 8002566C followed by 0x01 data.
