Step one:    copy the input samples to another buffer with a 10 sample interval to make room for 9 samples in between

Step two:    fill in the 9 samples in between the copied samples. Use linear interpolation for this
Step three:  copy from this temporary buffer starting on the 5th sample every tenth sample to another buffer with a 10 sample interval (So copy interpolated samples to the other buffer)
Step four:   in this second temporary buffer fill in the 9 samples in between the copied samples. Use linear interpolation for this
Step five:   make an average of the samples in the two temporary buffers back into the input buffer. Here they made an error. They start on the first sample of the first temporary buffer, but the -10th sample of the second temporary buffer, which is not written to in step three or four.
Step six:    copy samples from the in step five written input buffer starting on the second sample with a five sample interval to the second temporary buffer.
Step seven:  in this second temporary buffer fill in the 4 samples in between the copied samples. Use linear interpolation for this
Step eight:  average the samples in the in step five written input buffer with the samples in the second temporary buffer. Here they made a similar error as in step five. Correct start on the input buffer but incorrect on the second temporary buffer.
