List of commands
0x01    Write a data byte (0x00 or 0x01)
0x02    Write a data byte (0x00 or 0x01)    Channel 1 enable (0 disable, 1 enable) Only written at startup of the scope??

0x04    Write a data byte (0x00 or 0x01)


0x05    Read two bytes. No idea what it is for yet, but read every signal read cycle.


0x06    Check on FPGA version. Needs to return 0x1432. Only checked in a hardware check function, which can be enabled by changing two bytes in the flash memory. At address 0x001FE000 the code expects 0x9086 for skipping the check.


0x0A    Read a byte. Looks like a wait flag for checking if there is sample data. 


0x0D    Write 4 bytes to fpga via data register. (0x00 0x00 0x00 0x27 or 0x00 0x00 0x07 0xD0) Is used for the higher time / div settings


0x0E    Write 4 bytes to fpga via data register. Trigger time / div setting. Does not change for every setting since some of it is done in software.

For the signal data the scope does a software multiply when the 500mV/div is selected. So the sensitivity does not increase any further than 1V/div.

For the timebase there is also something done in software because for several settings the numbers set in the FPGA are the same.

========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

The settings here are based on 10x probe setting. For 1x setting the range will be 50mV to 5V and for 100x the range will be 5V to 500V
Need to investigate if the offset changes when the probe multiplier is changed

Channel 1 settings
0x32  Is some sort of offset. Changes when the trace on the screen is moved up or down.
0x33  Select the input scaling. See table below
0x34  Select ac or dc coupling. 0x00 is ac coupling. 0x01 is dc coupling.

From here on it seems that the FPGA switches to 0x0D for time base setting and the data is read with 0x24 and 0x26, 10 bytes per read. 0x28 is written 1 after or before every read sequence. 0x0D is also written
Once it switches to this state the special IC is no longer addressed. The scope just reads the data with the other hard coded FPGA commands. Probably based on timer interrupt.

========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================

There is some sequence on the 0x0D command. It first writes 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x27 and then 0x00 0x00 0x07 0xD0. This is not all the time, but after touch has been done. Looks like a kind of reset which is only done when
time base is switched to 100mS and up
