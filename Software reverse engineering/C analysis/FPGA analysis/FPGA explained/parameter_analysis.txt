The special ic is being called with the following ID's:

It is not a storage device, but some sort of translator.


0x0A   Get 16 bits data to write to the FPGA. The FPGA command is read with parameter ID 0x14. This is done in a single function.
       Called at startup followed by the 0x14


0x0B   Called when one or both channels are turned on.
       This id is send right after a 0x0C or 0x0D command. When both channels are enabled it is send twice
       The code shows it can be called with immediate numbers (hard coded) or variable numbers.
       The hard coded numbers are 0 - 5. Data captures also showed 6
       The chip seems to respond with fixed data for each input.
       send 0x00  return  0xAD
       send 0x01  return  0xAF
       send 0x02  return  0xB4
       send 0x03  return  0xB4
       send 0x04  return  0xB8
       send 0x05  return  0xB8
       send 0x06  return  0xB8


0x0C   Get FPGA command for channel 1 signal data reading. Turned of when the channel is turned of, otherwise it is called regular.


0x0D   Get FPGA command for channel 2 signal data reading. Turned of when the channel is turned of, otherwise it is called regular.


0x0E   Is called once in a while with a 32 bit value. Seems to return the same value.


0x0F


0x10   Display brightnes. Input is a value from 0x00 to 0x64. A 16 bit value is returend with max 0xEA60.


0x11   Called regular. Input data shifted right 4 bits and then 2 is added and returned as 12 bits value.


0x12


0x14   Input is always 0xED and a FPGA command is returned. Data fetched with ID 0x0A is written to the FPGA after this FPGA command.


0x15


0x16   16 bits result is written to FPGA command 0x3C.
       Called at startup.
