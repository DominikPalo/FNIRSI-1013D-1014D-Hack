The emulator provided a good insight in what the scope does.

Most of the commands have been identified of what they do, and are noted down in the FPGA explained.txt file.

The sequence of commands are being traced with the emulator.
The first file (Startup and signal data read sequence.txt) shows the startup and signal reading with both channels enabled and a time base set to 20uS/div.

Real life tests need to verify the actual working.
