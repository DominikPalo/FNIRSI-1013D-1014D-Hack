Found one buffer where the first set is a zero change line and the other is still a normal signal. Interleaved this will be crap

Found a buffer where the first 750 samples have a lower frequency then the upper 750 samples

Found a buffer where the last samples have some issue

It looks like that the time base setting 17 takes less samples, since the last ?? samples are from previous time base capture
