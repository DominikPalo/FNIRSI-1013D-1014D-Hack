at address 0x001B9E94 in the flash 0x18 needs to be changed into 0x1B to make the copy of the initial data block longer. Added 3 bytes to the data

starting at address 0x001BA651 the rx sensor data needs to be reversed.

0x14  ==>  0x02
0x12  ==>  0x04
0x10  ==>  0x06
0x0E  ==>  0x08
0x0C  ==>  0x0A
0x0A  ==>  0x0C
0x08  ==>  0x0E
0x06  ==>  0x10
0x04  ==>  0x12
0x02  ==>  0x14

at address 0x001BA65E the byte 0x10 needs to be changed in 0x11. This puts an extra zero in the data

starting at address 0x001BA65F the data needs to be changed and extended. 3 bytes need to be inserted.

the following data needs to be set from address 0x001BA65F on

0x28, 0x10, 0x02, 0x04, 0x06, 0x08, 0x0A, 0x0C, 0x1D, 0x1E, 0x1F, 0x20, 0x21, 0x22, 0x24, 0x26, 0x28, 0x24

This is the tx sensor data in the reversed order with a instruction to copy 4x 0xFF from previous data.

At address 0x001BA671 the data should be 0x49, 0x01 This is the next unpack instruction.

In the old setup the tx config was made up of the first 9 bytes of the sensor data and then the last 6 bytes of the rx sensor data was copied to fill in the remainder.

On startup of the main code it reads in some bytes from flash to determine if hardware check needs to be done.
There for it is important to remove three bytes just after the config data.

This can be done at address 0x001BA912. Remove three zero's
